# system_resistant_to_brute_force_attacks

## 📋 Project Summary
An advanced Arduino-based electronic lock system protected against brute-force attacks. The system demonstrates the risks of weak authentication mechanisms and the importance of basic security policies.

## 🛡️ Security Features
- **30-minute lock after 3 incorrect entries**
- **15-second entry timeout**
- **Exponential backoff lockup times**

- **Encrypted data storage in EEPROM**

- **Multiple error reporting systems**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Arduino UNO/Nano
- IR Remote Control System
- 16x2 LCD Screen (I2C)
- Relay Module
- LEDs and Buzzer
- Pins
- IR signal receiver
